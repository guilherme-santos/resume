## Summary

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience, specializing in backend development with Go‚Äîmy primary and preferred language since 2015. I‚Äôve designed and built distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven architectures across multiple industries including fintech, e-commerce, and AI platforms.

I enjoy working on greenfield projects and have led personal initiatives such as an ERP for SMEs with e-invoicing and a multi-currency investment tracker. My open-source contributions include well-known projects like gRPC-Gateway and Elastic‚Äôs Go client.

Beyond backend development, I‚Äôm comfortable across the stack‚Äîfrom infrastructure (Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD) to frontend when needed. I bring a product mindset, clean code, and strong communication skills. Currently open for freelance and consulting opportunities focused on Go-based systems, cloud-native apps, and high-performance backend platforms.
